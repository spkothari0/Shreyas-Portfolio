# Clone and Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- To run execute following command:
  ```node
  npm install
  ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.
- The icons on homepage under what i do section are from https://icon-sets.iconify.design/

### Github Information

You will find `git_data_fetcher.mjs` file in the main directory of the repository. This file is used to fetch the data (Pinned projects) from your github.

The env file will contain below details:
```javascript
GITHUB_TOKEN = your_token;
GITHUB_USERNAME = your_username;
```

To execute the `git_data_fetcher.mjs` execute below command :
```node
node git_data_fetcher.mjs
```
Each project's additional data(tech logo) is in `git_data_fetcher_helper.js` file.

The command will fetch all the data from my GitHub; every time there is an update in Git projects, run this command to get the latest data.
